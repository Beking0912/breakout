- When the ball strikes an object, it bounces off with a reflected arrival angle.
- The user can move the paddle left and right.
- When the ball strikes a brick, the brick disappears.
- The game ends when all bricks disappear.
- Play music.

## How to run

## How to Play:
- Slide your trackpad with two fingers to change the view.
- Move your mouse to control the position of the paddle.
- Try to hit all the bricks with the ball to make them disappear.
- If the ball misses the paddle, it will start over in a random direction.
- Keep playing until all the bricks have been cleared.

Enjoy the game and have fun breaking some bricks in 3D!
